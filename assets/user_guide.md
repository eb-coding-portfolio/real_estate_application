## Market Overview

1. **Begin with Selections:** Start by choosing the desired property types and metrics that align with your analysis goals.
2. **State Focus:** Click on a state from the map that piques your interest.
3. **Metros Heatmap:** Observe the heatmap (bottom left) updating to display metros within the selected state.
4. **Navigate & Compare:** Browse through the metros using the 'next' and 'previous' buttons. Adjust the metric for comparison, either at the state or national level.
    * **Comparison Insight:** The 'compare to' functionality calculates the difference between the metro metric and the reference metric. For example, if Austin, TX's `median_sale_price_yoy` is -9% and 'State' is selected, the state metric used will be Texas's `median_sale_price_yoy`. If it's 1%, the resulting value will be -9% - 1% = -10%.
5. **Deep Dive:** Once a metro stands out, click on its cell. The adjacent line chart will update, displaying raw data for the past 5 years for that YoY metric (e.g., `inventory_yoy` will show `inventory`), including a 12-month forecast.
